# Git and Github Workshop: Session 2

## Project Title: Methods Lunch workshop attendees page

**Objective:** By the end of this session, participants will have collaboratively created an interactive web page listing workshop attendees. Each attendeeâ€™s profile will include a name, affiliation, email, bio, and a profile image. Participants will learn to manage text-based files (HTML, CSS, and Markdown) and binary files (images) using Git, and experience both the collaborator and forking workflows.
